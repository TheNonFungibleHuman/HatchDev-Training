          <h2>What Makes Grown Men Cry?</h2>
          <p>
            Why the tears? So what's going on? Why does thinking about our
            legacy -- and the finality of our time on Earth and how we can make
            an impact -- cause grown men to cry? I suspect it's two-fold. First,
            thinking of your legacy means thinking about how people will
            remember you after you're gone. No one really wants to think about
            the morbid finality of that. It's tough. Even if you feel happy with
            how people will remember you and are content with your personal
            brand and reputation, it's hard not to get a little weepy when that
            topic surfaces. No one really likes to think about it.
            overlay-clever The second part of the tears, I believe, comes, in
            larger part, from when the legacy you'll likely leave misaligns with
            the one you want to leave. That disconnect becomes a tough pill to
            swallow, especially if you're older. Maybe your wife and kids will
            remember you as a workaholic. Maybe your team won't view you as
            charitable or the most understanding manager or just not an overall
            good person. Or, maybe you feel solid about your leadership and
            character; but you never pursued your childhood dreams -- your true
            calling.

          <h2>Why Did Elon Musk buy Twitter?</h2>
          <p>
            Elon Musk claims that he is buying Twitter to "help humanity" as the
            billionaire set out his aims for taking over the social media
            platform. In a tweet, Mr Musk said he didn't buy the firm "to make
            more money. I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love". The
            entrepreneur has until Friday to complete a $44bn (Â£38bn) takeover
            of Twitter or risk going to trial. The tweet addressed to Twitter's
            advertisers states that he has "acquired" the firm. However, there
            has been no official confirmation that the deal has been completed.
            Earlier this week, Mr Musk published a video of himself walking into
            Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink, raising speculation about
            his aims for the firm. "Entering Twitter HQ - let that sink in!" Mr
            Musk wrote. In business parlance, "kitchen sinking" means taking
            radical action at a company, though it is not clear if this was Mr
            Musk's message - he also updated his Twitter bio to read "chief
            twit". In his latest tweet, Mr Musk set out some of his goals for
            the company, saying that Twitter must be "warm and welcoming for
            all".
